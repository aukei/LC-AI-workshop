# Two-slide Summary for AI Adoption and AI Bubble

## Slide 1: MIT report on AI adoption – 80% project failure

- Why AI adoption fails
  - Lack of clear problem framing and measurable outcomes
  - Insufficient data quality, governance, and data availability
  - Overpromising on capabilities; underestimating change management needs
  - Inadequate alignment between business strategy and AI initiatives
  - Fragmented ecosystems: disparate tools, architectures, and vendor lock-in

- How big players respond to the market
  - Invest in AI platforms that unify data, models, and governance
  - Emphasize responsible AI, risk controls, and explainability to gain trust
  - Build AI-enabled products with a strong product-market fit and clear ROI
  - Accelerate through modular pilots, scalable data pipelines, and cloud-native infra
  - Partner ecosystems: leverage ecosystems to accelerate deployment and adoption

- What business value AI agents could deliver
  - End-to-end process automation with measurable ROI (cost savings, cycle time)
  - Real-time decision support and optimization across operations
  - Personalization at scale for customers and employees
  - Enhanced risk management, anomaly detection, and predictive insights
  - Faster experimentation and hypothesis testing with rapid prototyping

## Slide 2: AI bubble burst – Enterprise data and knowledge

- Enterprise data and knowledge: what remains after the bubble
  - Data foundations that survive: trustworthy data, data quality, metadata, lineage
  - Scaled knowledge graphs and reusable AI-ready datasets
  - Strong data governance, security, and privacy controls
  - Standardized interfaces: APIs, data contracts, and interoperability

- How to approach the remaining value
  - Invest in data platforms that enable discovery, access, and governance
  - Focus on reusable AI components with clear ROI (agents, templates, workflows)
  - Emphasize explainability, auditability, and compliance to sustain trust
  - Build modular AI capabilities that can be integrated into existing systems
  - Shift from hype to disciplined execution: pilots → production, with measurable benefits
## Fact-check notes and sources (for slide accuracy)

- MIT report on AI adoption: 80% of AI projects failing is a commonly cited figure in industry discussions, but exact methodology and framing vary by study and publication. When presenting, reference the specific MIT/industry study you’re drawing from and note the context (definition of "failure," scope, and time frame). Consider adding a brief citation and a footnote on methodology.
- AI agent business value: State that potential value is highly context-dependent (process type, data quality, governance, and organizational readiness). Use language that reflects uncertainty where appropriate, e.g., "potential ROI in pilot programs" rather than guaranteed outcomes.
- AI bubble burst and enterprise data: The narrative around an "AI bubble burst" is debated; instead, frame this as a maturation of AI investment. When discussing what remains, emphasize data quality, governance, interoperability, and reusable components as durable assets.

If you’d like, I can add a slide-ready references section with placeholders for the MIT study, industry reports, and credible sources to replace with exact citations.
